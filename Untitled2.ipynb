It was created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991.Python is popular because it is easy to learn, has a simple syntax, and offers versatility for various applications like web development, data science, and machine learning. It has a vast library ecosystem, is open-source, cross-platform, and supported by a large community, enabling rapid development and innovation.\n"

For example, two lists with identical elements will return True with == but False with is if they are stored in different memory locations. However, for small immutable objects like strings or integers, Python may reuse memory (interning), so both == and is might return True. In short, == compares content, and is compares identity.\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "-Logical operators in Python, such as and, or, and not, are used to perform operations on Boolean values. The and operator returns True if both conditions are True, while or returns True if at least one condition is True. The not operator reverses the Boolean value of a condition. These operators are essential for combining conditions and controlling program flow based on multiple criteria.\n",

It happens without the programmer's intervention. For example, adding an integer to a float results in an implicit conversion of the integer to a float. On the other hand, explicit type casting requires the programmer to manually convert one data type to another using functions like int(), float(), or str(). This allows the programmer to control the conversion process. In short, implicit casting is automatic, while explicit casting is done intentionally by the programmer.\n"
